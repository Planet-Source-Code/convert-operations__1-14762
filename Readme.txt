1. What does this do
This niftey little program converts visual basic 6 files to visual basic 5 files in seconds (well, how ever fast you are) :)

It removes the Retained=0 line and DebugStartUpOption=0 line from the vbp file.

I hate when people using VB6 mark their projects as VB6 only, when 98% of them could, and will, work in VB5. But try it, use VB5 to open a VB6 file, and you get an error saying that "Retained is an invalid key".
Most people don't know how to stop this, and disregard any VB6 file as useable under VB5. This program puts a stop to this.

========================================================

2. Help & how to use
The operation is very simple, just run the program, and find a VB6 vbp file. if you can't find one, or just want to test the program, the TestVB6.vbp will work fine. Just to prove that it is a VB6 made project, open it.
Now run Convert Operations, and follow these instructions:
Click Open, Check, Convert, and you are finished. It IS that simple. Now open the file you converted, and run! Look, no error!!!!!!!!

If you are quick, then you should see that there is always retained=0 in a VB6 project.
